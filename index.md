Hello World, in process of migrating towards github pages and educating myself about all the web, markup language and other knowledges that I glossed in using Wordpress CMS for all the things I put on the web. Bear with me!   
Old website has been affixed in the amber of the [WebArchive](http://web.archive.org/web/20190709110541/http://www.stephenfortune.net/) - [projects and workshops](http://web.archive.org/web/20190304100628/http://www.stephenfortune.net/residencies-prototypes-workshops/) from that site will be migrated here presently. Blog is current to [2017](http://web.archive.org/web/20180316123737/http://www.stephenfortune.net/blog/).
